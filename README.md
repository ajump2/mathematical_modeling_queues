# Introduction
This repo contains the code for our team's (Adam Jump, Amy Vennos, and Richard Quackenbush) simulations from the 2017 COMAP MCM. These simulations accompanied a paper which was awarded the distinction of meritorious. Also included is the poster which was presented at Salisbury University Student Research Conference, and the MAA section meetings in Frostburg, Maryland.

## Simulations
We used Mathematica to model our systems, as well as gain understanding surrounding queueing processes. We used the available QueueingProcess command (given arguments found from our research) combined with DirectedEdge to create Graph data structures. This allowed us to find shortest paths, maximum and minimum network flows, and general means regarding total system time. From here we were able to alter the system to optimally decrease total system time, which we then reported in our final paper.
